# yolov8-Aimbot

apex.pt is weight trained of 10k images but with only 50 epochs idk it works but not good i get around 39 fps with 400 fov or so 
best.pt is for the targets in the firing range but these copied datasets where dog and it has problems detecting when ur on the target thus aiming at another one and when off again it aims on again and soo on.....
